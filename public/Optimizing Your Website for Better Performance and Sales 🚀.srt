Hey there, my name's Cristian and I help e-commerce brands create product pages that

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,043
are incredibly fast and smooth for their customers.

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:09,642
In the next minute, I'll show you a quick before and after.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,408
And you'll see the exact performance improvements that we get.

5
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:21,403
Lighthouse Report. Now,

6
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,770
since this is the unoptimized version of the web page,

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,475
we have an image that's much too large.

8
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,656
We have layout shifts. As you can see here,

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,797
we have a script running in the background. background. That makes the site slow

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,230
and clunky for users to navigate through. And all these lead to,

11
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:38,338
as you can see here, a performance of 38.

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,108
Where we get a largest contentful paint of 12 seconds,

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,561
a total blocking time of 570 milliseconds,

14
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,700
and a cumulative layout shift of 0.139.

15
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,777
All of which not only your users don't like,

16
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:53,374
but Google doesn't like either. And it  pushes your site down below everybody else's

17
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,096
on the web search rankings. Luckily,

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,612
however, all these problems are completely fixable.

19
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,317
Here, I'm going We have the same website,

20
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:03,925
same layout, same font, same description,

21
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,398
same everything. Except this time,

22
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,117
when we run our Lighthouse report, since this is our optimized version,

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:12,992
we have an image that actually fits and is to scale.

24
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,608
We have no layout shifts happening anywhere within the site.

25
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:20,608
And we defer all background scripts that are not important to make it feel

26
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,821
fast and quick to navigate. Leading to,

27
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:26,027
as you can see here, a performance of 100.

28
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:29,215
Or we have a much better LCP of 0.7 seconds.

29
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:33,536
We have a TBT of 0 milliseconds and a CLS of 0.

30
00:01:33,537 --> 00:01:37,525
All of these lead to a professional and quick-feeling website  that your users love

31
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:40,473
and Google loves to. Putting your website at the top of  all the web

32
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:45,176

structure data and SEO schema fixes, and complete before and after report,
